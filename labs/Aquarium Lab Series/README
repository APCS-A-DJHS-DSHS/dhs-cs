.classpath probably won't work on Windows, due to the way Eclipse handles
project JDK versions. 

Luckily, fixing this issue isn't a huge pain.

 - Right-click on the project and click "Properties" in the menu
 - On the left side of the window that pops up, there should be a line reading
   "Java Build Path". Click that.
 - On the right side of the window, you should see four buttons near the top:
   Source, Projects, Libraries, and Order and Export. Click on Libraries.
 - Click on the missing library and hit "Remove"
 - Click "Add Library..."
 - Pick "JRE System Library"
 - Two options:
   - Use whatever Eclipse says your JRE is by default (the bottom button)
   - Use a different version of Java if you have it. Versions can be found:
     - OS X: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.<version>.0<something>.jdk/Contents/Home
     - Windows: <drive letter>:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.<version>.<something> 
  - Hit "Finish"

Things *should* be ok at this point. 

To do: Create a Windows .classpath, set up hook to take care of packaging
