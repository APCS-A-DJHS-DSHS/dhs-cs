and an <strong>Exercise</strong>.</p>

<p>
In the exercises that precede this one, students will have created a
vector of fish that move randomly back and forth in an aquarium,
being careful not to hit the sides.
Students should understand how to
identify the responsibilities of different classes,
construct class methods,
and use instance variables within methods.</p>

<H2>Ascending and Descending Fish</H2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Our program would be much more interesting if the fish moved up and down
as well as side to side.
In this exercise, you will implement two new methods in the
<code>AquaFish</code> class, <code>ascend</code> and <code>descend</code>,
to support this behavior.</p>

<H4>Exercise: Simulation Up and Down Movement</H4>

      <ul>
        <LI>To make the simulation more believable, the distance that a fish moves 
          up or down should be related to its height. Fish come in different sizes, 
          so the size of any particular fish is one of the properties of that 
          fish. Its position in the aquarium is another relevant property for 
          this exercise. Read the <a href="StartingCode/AquaFish.java">implementation 
          (code) for the AquaFish class</a> to determine which methods or instance 
          variables will be useful in implementing <code>ascend</code> and <code>descend</code>. 
          <p></p>
        </li>
        <LI>Determine what parameters (if any) you will need for the new <code>ascend</code> 
          method. Then determine what its return type should be. Add an empty 
          <code>ascend</code> method (one that consists of a declaration and empty 
          braces) to the <code>AquaFish</code> class after the <code>moveForward</code> 
          and <code>changeDir</code> methods. 
          <p></p>
        </li>
        <LI>Implement the <code>ascend</code> method. You may use the <code>moveForward</code> 
          method as a guide if you like, but the <code>ascend</code> method is 
          simpler. The movement amount should simply be the height of the fish. 
          Research the specification for the <a href="JavaDocs/AquaPoint.html">AquaPoint</a> 
          class to discover what methods might be useful in implementing the <code>ascend</code> 
          and <code>descend</code> methods. 
          <p></p>
        </li>
        <LI>Implement the <code>descend</code> method.

        </li>
        <LI>Modify your <code>main</code> method in the <code>AquaSimApplication</code> 
          class to allow fish to ascend or descend before moving forward, according 
          to the following formula: 
          <ul>
            <li>A fish at the surface has a 2/3 chance of descending and a 1/3 
              chance of staying at the surface.</li>
            <li>A fish at the bottom has a 1/3 chance of ascending and a 2/3 chance 
              of staying at the bottom.</li>
            <li>A fish that is neither at the surface nor at the bottom has a 
              1/3 chance of ascending, a 1/3 chance of descending, and a 1/3 chance 
              of staying at the same depth.</li>
          </ul>
          Read the <a href="StartingCode/AquaFish.java">implementation (code) 
          for the AquaFish class</a> to determine what methods are available to 
          tell whether a fish is at the surface, at the bottom, or somewhere in 
          between.&nbsp; (These methods do not appear in the partial specification 
          for the <code>AquaFish</code> class that you have used previously.)

<H2>Responsible Fish</H2>

<p></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
One of the most important tasks in designing and implementing
object-oriented programs is deciding which classes or objects are
responsible for executing which behavior.  Up until now, all of the
behavior that you have added to the Aquarium Simulation program has been
in the <code>main</code> method of the <code>AquaSimApplication</code>
class.  Now it's time to make the program more object-oriented.
For example,
deciding whether a fish should change direction or ascend or descend
when it moves should
be the responsibility of the fish, not of the simulation program.</p>

<p>
In this exercise, you will implement a <code>move</code> method in the
<code>AquaFish</code> class that will encapsulate all of the 
behavior related to movement (ascending, descending, changing
direction, and moving forward).</p>

<H4>Exercise: Make Fish Responsible for Knowing How to Move</H4>

        <ul>
          <li>Analyze the <code>main</code> method of the <code>AquaSimApplication</code> 
            class to determine which lines of code should be moved to the <code>move</code> 
            method you will be implementing in the <code>AquaFish</code> class. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <LI>Determine what parameters (if any) you will need for the new <code>move</code> 
            method. Then determine what its return type should be. Add an empty 
            <code>move</code> method (one that consists of a declaration and empty 
            braces) to the <code>AquaFish</code> class before the <code>moveForward</code> 
            method. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li>Move the appropriate lines of code from the <code>main</code> method 
            in <code>AquaSimApplication</code> to the <code>move</code> in <code>AquaFish</code>. 
            Notice that the <code>main</code> method was invoking <code>AquaFish</code> 
            methods such as <code>changeDir</code> on a named fish. The <code>move</code> 
            method, though, is tied to the <code>AquaFish</code> class. More specifically, 
            it is always tied to (or executed by) a particular fish. Thus, instead 
            of <code>main</code> invoking methods such as <code>changeDir</code> 
            on a named fish, the fish should now be invoking methods on itself. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li>Modify the <code>main</code> method in <code>AquaSimApplication</code> 
            to simply tell each fish to move, letting the fish worry about how 
            it should move.

<H2>Modeling a Simulation</H2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In a well-designed object-oriented program, we usually want the
<code>main</code> function to just create some objects and get the ball
rolling.
Most of the program behavior should be the result of the objects
interacting with each other.
In the Aquarium Simulation program, though, the <code>main</code>
function is actually running the simulation.
We have objects that model the fish and the aquarium,
but not one that models the simulation itself.</p>

<p>
In this exercise, you will write the code for methods in a
<code>Simulation</code> class.  The constructor will initialize the
<code>Simulation</code> object's instance variables and construct the
fish in the aquarium.
The <code>step</code> method will
execute the commands that should happen each timestep in the simulation
(moving the fish, in our case).
<!--
It will also display the contents
of the aquarium after each step.
--></p>

<p> Once you have implemented the <code>Simulation</code> class, the <code>main</code> 
  method in <code>AquaSimApplication</code> will merely create a number of objects, 
  such as the aquarium, the graphical user interface, and the simulation object, 
  and then ask the simulation object to run the simulation. The <code>main</code> 
  method will also still display the initial configuration of the fish and the 
  modified aquarium after each timestep. </p>

<H4>Exercise: Introduce the Simulation Class</H4>

        <ul>
          
        <li>Read <a href="JavaDocs/Simulation.html">the specification for the 
          Simulation</a> class to familiarize yourself with what the class should 
          do. 
          <p> </p></li>
          <li>Download <a href="StartingCode/Simulation.java">the incomplete Simulation 
            class implementation</a> if you don't have it already. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li>Read the incomplete <code>Simulation</code> class implementation 
            and then modify the constructor to initialize the instance variables. 
            <p> Notice that <code>Simulation</code> objects have three instance 
              variables and that the constructor takes three parameters. Two of 
              the three instance variables represent the same objects as two of 
              the parameters, so you can initialize them directly. For example, 
              the <code>main</code> method in <code>AquaSimApplication</code> 
              will construct an <code>Aquarium</code> and pass it to the <code>Simulation</code> 
              constructor. The <code>Simulation</code> object should refer to 
              the same <code>Aquarium</code> object, not a new one. On the other 
              hand, looking at the parameters to the <code>Simulation</code> constructor, 
              we can see that the <code>main</code> method will not construct 
              an array of fish and pass it to the constructor. Instead, it will 
              pass the number of fish that should be in the array. Therefore, 
              to initialize the <code>allFish</code> instance variable, you will 
              need to construct a new array of fish. </p>
            <p> </p></li>
          <li>Move the appropriate lines of code that construct various colored 
            fish from the <code>main</code> method in <code>AquaSimApplication</code> 
            to the <code>Simulation</code> constructor. Double-check whether the 
            instance variables in the <code>Simulation</code> constructor have 
            the same names that the local variables in the <code>main</code> method 
            had. Do not move the code that displays the initial configuration; 
            for now, that code should stay in <code>main</code>. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li> Replace the code in the <code>main</code> method that constructed 
            all the fish with a statement that constructs a <code>Simulation</code> 
            object. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li>Determine what code in <code>main</code> represents a single timestep 
            in the simulation. Move that code to the <code>step</code> method 
            in <code>Simulation</code>. Adjust any variable names if necessary. 
            Do not move the code that displays the modified aquarium and fish 
            after each timestep; for now, that code should stay in the <code>main</code> 
            method. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li> Replace the code in the <code>main</code> method that represented 
            a single timestep in the simulation with a call to the <code>step</code> 
            method in <code>Simulation</code>. 
            <p> </p></li>
          <li>Test your program to verify that the behavior is unchanged. </li>

        <H4>Analysis Questions</H4>

<ul>

<li>Notice that the constructor uses instance variables, parameters, and
local variables.  For example, the following statement
  <pre><code>
  allFish[i] = new AquaFish(aqua, color);
</code></pre>
uses two instance variables and two local variables.  How can you
determine whether a given identifier is a local variable, a parameter,
or an instance variable?

<p></p></li>
<li>If you had the following code
  <pre><code>
  AquaFish[] allFish = new AquaFish[numFish];   <font color="red">// WARNING!</font>
  ...
  allFish[i] = new AquaFish(aqua, color);
</code></pre>
            in the constructor, would you be putting new fish in the instance 
            variable called <code>allFish</code> or in a local variable? How would 
            this affect the behavior of the <code>step</code> method? </li>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The user of the Aquarium Simulation program can control how many fish to
put in the aquarium and how many simulation steps to run, but cannot
control the pace of the simulation.  We can give the user more control
over how the simulation runs by providing Step and Run buttons.</p>

<H4>Exercise: Allow User to Control Simulation</H4>

      <ul>
        <li>The <code>AquaSimGUI</code> class has a fourth constructor that allows 
          you to specify whether or not to have the graphical user interface interact 
          directly with a <code>Simulation</code> class. Research the abbreviated 
          specification for the <a href="JavaDocs/AquaSimGUI.html">AquaSimGUI</a> 
          class to discover how to use this constructor. Modify the <code>main</code> 
          method in <code>AquaSimApplication</code> to indicate that the graphical 
          user interface should use the <code>Simulation</code> class. Once you 
          have done this you no longer need to wait for the user to push the Start 
          button, ask for the number of fish or number of simulation steps, construct 
          the Simulation object, diplay the aquarium, or run the simulation. The 
          graphical user interface will do all of that. Therefore, the construction 
          of the graphical user interface should be the last line of code before 
          the WRAP UP phase.

          classes to reflect your changes. </li>
